## What is Piri?

What's Piri? It's the _**P**rovable **I**nformation **R**etention **I**nterface_ - a Go-based storage node that's part of the Storacha network backbone. It works alongside other services like the [indexing service](https://github.com/storacha/indexing-service) and [upload service](https://github.com/storacha/upload-service) to enable decentralized storage with cryptographic proofs.
