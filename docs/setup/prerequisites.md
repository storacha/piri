# Prerequisites

This document outlines the common prerequisites for running Piri services. Specific services may have additional requirements noted in their respective guides.

## System Requirements

### Operating System
- **Linux-based OS** (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **macOS** (for development)

### Hardware
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 8+ GB
- **Storage**: 1+ TB
- **Network**: 1+ Gbps symmetric connection

## Software Requirements

### Required Packages

Install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make git jq curl wget nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

## Network Requirements

### Domain Names
You'll need **two fully qualified domain names (FQDN)**:
- `piri.example.com` - for Piri UCAN server
- `up.piri.example.com` - for Piri PDP Server

### Firewall Configuration
Open the following ports:

```bash
# HTTP/HTTPS (required)
ufw allow 80/tcp 
ufw allow 443/tcp
```

## Filecoin Prerequisites

### Lotus Node Setup
A [Lotus node](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus) is required for interacting with the PDP Smart Contract deployed on the Filecoin [Calibration Network](https://docs.filecoin.io/networks/calibration).

**Requirements:**
- Latest Calibration Network [Snapshot](https://forest-archive.chainsafe.dev/latest/calibnet/)
- Synced Lotus node with [ETH RPC enabled](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/configure/ethereum-rpc/#enableethrpc)
- WebSocket endpoint (e.g., `wss://lotus.example.com/rpc/v1`)
- Basic understanding of Filecoin primitives

### Funded Delegated Wallet

A Lotus Delegated Address is required by Piri for interacting with the PDP Smart Contract. This guide assumes you have already setup a lotus node as described in the [pre-requisites document](./prerequisites.md). Please refer to the official [Filecoin Docs](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/filecoin-evm-runtime/address-types#delegated-addresses) for more details on delegated addresses.

**Step 1: Generate a Delegated Address**

```bash
lotus wallet new delegated
```

Example output: `t410fzmmaqcn3j6jidbyrqqsvayejt6sskofwash6zoi`

**Step 2: Fund the Address**

1. Visit the [Calibration faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/funds.html)
2. Request funds for your new address
3. Verify funding:

   ```bash
   lotus wallet balance YOUR_DELEGATED_ADDRESS
   ```
