# Choose Your Installation Method

Now that you've initialized your Piri node configuration, you need to choose how to install and run Piri.

## Prerequisites

Before choosing your installation method, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ [Initialized your Piri node](./initialization.md) and have a `config.toml` file

## Two Installation Methods

### Option A: Service Installation (Recommended)

**For production nodes**, we **strongly recommend service installation** because it provides:

- ‚úÖ **Automatic patch updates** - Checks for new patch releases every 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Automatic restart on failure** - Systemd monitors and restarts your node
- ‚úÖ **Starts on system boot** - Your node runs automatically when the server starts
- ‚úÖ **Centralized logging** - View logs with `journalctl`
- ‚úÖ **Easy rollback** - Previous versions are kept for quick rollback
- ‚úÖ **Managed installation** - All files organized in `/opt/piri/`

**Best for:** Production storage providers, long-running nodes, automated operations

üëâ **[Install as Service](./service-installation.md)** (Recommended)

---

### Option B: Manual Installation

**For development or testing**, manual installation gives you:

- Full control over when to update
- No systemd dependency
- Flexibility to run in non-standard environments
- Suitable for temporary or experimental setups

**Best for:** Development, testing, learning, non-systemd environments

üëâ **[Manual Installation](./manual-installation.md)**

## Comparison

| Feature | Service Installation | Manual Installation |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Auto-updates** | ‚úÖ Every 30 minutes (patch only) | ‚ùå Manual updates required |
| **Auto-restart** | ‚úÖ On failure | ‚ùå Manual restart |
| **Boot on startup** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Must configure manually |
| **Logging** | ‚úÖ journalctl | ‚ùå Manual setup |
| **Rollback** | ‚úÖ Easy | ‚ùå Manual backup/restore |
| **Best for** | Production | Development/Testing |

## Still Deciding?

**Choose Service Installation if:**
- You're running a production storage node
- You want automatic updates and reliability
- You're using a systemd-based Linux distribution

**Choose Manual Installation if:**
- You're testing or developing
- You need full control over the update process
- You're not using systemd
- This is a temporary setup
