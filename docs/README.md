# Piri Documentation

Welcome to the Piri documentation!
Piri is the software run by all storage providers on the Storacha network. 
Piri can run entirely on its own with no software other than Filecoin Lotus, or it can integrate with a Filecoin storage provider operation running Curio.

## 🎯 Which Guide Should I Follow?

### "I want to run a standalone Piri storage provider"
→ Follow the **[Full Stack Setup](./integrations/full-stack-setup.md)** guide

### "I already run Curio and want to add Storacha support"
→ Follow the **[Piri with Curio](./integrations/piri-with-curio.md)** guide

### "I just want to understand the architecture"
→ Read the **[Architecture Overview](./architecture.md)**

### "I want to run only a PDP server"
→ Follow the **[PDP Server Setup](./guides/pdp-server-piri.md)** guide

### "I want to run only a UCAN server"

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Generate a Server Identity (keypair)
```bash
piri identity generate > service.pem
```
See the [PEM File Generation](./common/key-generation.md) guide for details.

### Check Server Health
```bash
# UCAN server
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# PDP server
curl https://pdp.your-domain.com/health
```

### Create a Proof Set
```bash
piri client pdp proofset create --key-file=service.pem --node-url=https://pdp.your-domain.com --record-keeper=YOUR_RECORD_KEEPER_ADDRESS
```

## 🆘 Getting Help
