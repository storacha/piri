	JournalModeDELETE JournalMode = "DELETE"

	// JournalModeTRUNCATE journaling mode commits transactions by truncating the rollback journal to zero-length instead
	// of deleting it. On many systems, truncating a file is much faster than deleting the file since the containing
	// directory does not need to be changed.
	JournalModeTRUNCATE JournalMode = "TRUNCATE"

	// JournalModePERSIST journaling mode prevents the rollback journal from being deleted at the end of each transaction.
	// Instead, the header of the journal is overwritten with zeros.
	// This will prevent other database connections from rolling the journal back.
	// The PERSIST journaling mode is useful as an optimization on platforms where deleting or truncating a file is much
	// more expensive than overwriting the first block of a file with zeros.
	// See also: PRAGMA journal_size_limit and SQLITE_DEFAULT_JOURNAL_SIZE_LIMIT.
	JournalModePERSIST JournalMode = "PERSIST"

	// JournalModeMEMORY journaling mode stores the rollback journal in volatile RAM.
	// This saves disk I/O but at the expense of database safety and integrity.

	// then the database file will very likely go corrupt.
	JournalModeMEMORY JournalMode = "MEMORY"

	// JournalModeWAL journaling mode uses a write-ahead log instead of a rollback journal to implement transactions.
	// The WAL journaling mode is persistent; after being set it stays in effect across multiple database connections and
	// after closing and reopening the database.
	// A database in WAL journaling mode can only be accessed by SQLite version 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) or later.
	JournalModeWAL JournalMode = "WAL"

	// JournalModeOFF journaling mode disables the rollback journal completely.
	// No rollback journal is ever created and hence there is never a rollback journal to delete.
	// The OFF journaling mode disables the atomic commit and rollback capabilities of SQLite.
	// The ROLLBACK command no longer works; it behaves in an undefined way.
	// Applications must avoid using the ROLLBACK command when the journal mode is OFF.
	// If the application crashes in the middle of a transaction when the OFF journaling mode is set, then the database
	// file will very likely go corrupt. Without a journal, there is no way for a statement to unwind partially completed
	// operations following a constraint error. This might also leave the database in a corrupted state.
	// For example, if a duplicate entry causes a CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement to fail half-way through, it will leave
	// behind a partially created, and hence corrupt, index.
	// Because OFF journaling mode allows the database file to be corrupted using ordinary SQL, it is disabled when
	// SQLITE_DBCONFIG_DEFENSIVE is enabled.
